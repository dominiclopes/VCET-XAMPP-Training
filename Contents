After we create a website/webapplication we would want it to be used by people across the globe. 
For this we require a machine which would serve these requests. Requests by the users to view/use the website/webapplication. This machine is called as the web server, wouldn't we ?
We also would require a database service, to provide us the ability to store the data we require for our website or generate from our webapplication, wouldn't we ?

Before we release our website/webapplication for general use. We need to make sure if works perfectly. It is error prone.
To test our website/webapplication on our local machines, we will use XAMPP, which will setup the webserver, the database service and the PHP interpreter(executing the server side code written in PHP)

Download and Install XAMPP. 
https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html
Note: We are downloading the latest version of XAMPP
The XAMPP software installed on college comuters might be an older version of the software.


If we have completed the download and installed OR we already have XAMPP installed on our systems !
Verify the version of Apache, PHP, Mysql/Mariadb -> Go to you XAMPP application -> Open Shell ->
for Apache, type : httpd -v
for PHP, type : php -v
for mysql/mariadb, type : mysql --version


To verify Apache Webserver is up and running, Type in your browser : localhost
To verify Database Service is up and running, Go XAMPP control panel and click on the ADMIN button of Mysql: It opens up the phpmyadmin page
To go to your website, in your browser type: localhost/project_folder_name_in_htdocs_folder/webpage_name


Let's think of a Problem Statement, 
think of any appliaction you want to create, 
an appliaction which requires to store some data in the database
an application which requires to get data from the database and display it to the users



Conclusion:
There are various webservers, databases, web technologies out there in the market, just try to read about them.
Find out what interest you the most. 
Todays, session was all about getting you started, with webserver and databases
